## Introduction
UTF-8 Validation is the process of verifying whether a sequence of bytes represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all valid Unicode code points. Validating UTF-8 encoded data is essential for ensuring compatibility and correctness in text processing and internationalization tasks.

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers representing a sequence of bytes, implement a function or method to determine if the sequence represents a valid UTF-8 encoding according to the UTF-8 encoding rules.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the UTF-8 Validation problem typically involves examining each byte in the sequence and applying the UTF-8 encoding rules to determine its validity. This may include checking the leading byte for its format and the following bytes for their conformity to UTF-8 encoding standards.

## Usage
To use the UTF-8 Validation solution provided in this repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
	git clone https://github.com/tris-raki/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the `0x04-utf8_validation` directory:
	cd alx-interview/0x04-utf8_validation
3. Run the UTF-8 validation script:
	python utf8_validation.py
Modify the script as needed to test with your own data or integrate it into your project.
