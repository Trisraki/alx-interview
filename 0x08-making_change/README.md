## Introduction
The Making Change problem involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a specified set of coin denominations. This problem is commonly encountered in algorithms, computer science education, and real-world scenarios such as cashier operations and vending machines.

## Problem Statement
Given an integer representing the amount of change to be made and an array of coin denominations, implement a function or algorithm to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make the change. The algorithm should return the minimum number of coins and the combination of coins used to make the change.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Making Change problem typically involves dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation to efficiently find the minimum number of coins needed for each amount. By systematically exploring all possible combinations of coins and optimizing the solution, we can solve the problem with optimal time and space complexity.

## Usage
To use the Making Change solution provided in this repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
	git clone https://github.com/tris-raki/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the `0x08-making_change` directory:
	cd alx-interview/0x08-making_change
3. Run the Python script to make change for a sample amount using sample coin denominations:
	python making_change.py
Modify the script as needed to test with different amounts and coin denominations or integrate the making change function into your own projects.
