## Introduction
The Island Perimeter problem involves counting the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid represents either land (1) or water (0), and adjacent land cells are considered to be connected horizontally or vertically. The goal is to determine the total perimeter of the island.

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid representing an island, where 1 represents land and 0 represents water, implement a function or algorithm to calculate the perimeter of the island. The perimeter of the island is defined as the total length of the boundary separating the land from the water.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Island Perimeter problem typically involves traversing the grid and counting the number of edges where land cells meet water cells or the boundary of the grid. By iterating through each cell and examining its neighbors, we can calculate the perimeter efficiently.

## Usage
To use the Island Perimeter solution provided in this repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
	git clone https://github.com/tris-raki/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the `0x09-island_perimeter` directory:
	cd alx-interview/0x09-island_perimeter
3. Run the Python script to calculate the perimeter of a sample island grid:
	python island_perimeter.py
Modify the script as needed to test with different island grids or integrate the perimeter calculation function into your own projects.
