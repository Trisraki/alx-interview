## Introduction
The Rotate 2D Matrix problem involves rotating a square matrix (2D array) by 90 degrees in place. This problem is often encountered in computer graphics, image processing, and algorithmic problem-solving tasks.

## Problem Statement
Given a square matrix represented as a 2D array, implement a function or algorithm to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place. The rotation should be performed directly on the input matrix without using extra space.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Rotate 2D Matrix problem typically involves a series of matrix transformations and swaps to achieve the desired rotation. By dividing the rotation process into multiple steps and carefully updating the matrix elements, we can rotate the matrix in place efficiently.

## Usage
To use the Rotate 2D Matrix solution provided in this repository:
