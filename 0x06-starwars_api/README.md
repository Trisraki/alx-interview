## Introduction
The Star Wars API project allows users to interact with various endpoints to retrieve information about characters, films, starships, planets, and more from the vast Star Wars universe. It provides a fun and educational way to explore and learn about the rich lore and history of Star Wars.

## Project Overview
The Star Wars API project consists of a series of API endpoints that provide access to different categories of data related to the Star Wars franchise. Users can make HTTP requests to these endpoints to retrieve information such as character details, film summaries, starship specifications, planet climates, and much more.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in this repository includes sample code and scripts for interacting with the Star Wars API endpoints. The scripts are written in Python and demonstrate how to make HTTP requests using libraries like `requests` and process the JSON responses to extract relevant information.

## Usage
To use the Star Wars API scripts provided in this repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
	git clone https://github.com/tris-raki/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the `0x06-starwars_api` directory:

3. Run the Python scripts to interact with different endpoints:
	python characters.py
	python films.py
	python starships.py
	python planets.py
Modify the scripts or create your own to explore additional endpoints or customize the output.
