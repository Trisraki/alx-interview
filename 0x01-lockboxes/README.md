## Introduction
The Lockboxes problem is a common algorithmic challenge where you're given a set of locked boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine whether you can unlock all the boxes by iterating through the keys.

## Problem Statement
Given a list of lists where each list represents a box and contains keys to other boxes, implement a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` to determine if all boxes can be unlocked. The function should return `True` if all boxes can be unlocked, otherwise `False`.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Lockboxes problem typically involves using breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithms to explore the relationships between the boxes and their keys. By maintaining a set of visited boxes and iteratively traversing through the keys, we can determine if all boxes are accessible.

## Usage
To use the Lockboxes solution provided in this repository:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
