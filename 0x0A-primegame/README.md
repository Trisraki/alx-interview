## Introduction
The Prime Game problem involves playing a game where players take turns selecting prime numbers from a given range until no prime numbers are left. The goal is to devise an optimal strategy to win the game by selecting the maximum number of prime numbers.

## Problem Statement
Given a range of integers and the number of turns in the game, implement a function or algorithm to determine the winner of the Prime Game. Players take turns selecting prime numbers from the range, and the player with the most prime numbers selected at the end wins the game.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Prime Game problem typically involves generating prime numbers within the given range efficiently and devising a winning strategy based on mathematical properties of prime numbers. By understanding the characteristics of prime numbers and implementing a strategic approach, we can determine the optimal moves to win the game.
