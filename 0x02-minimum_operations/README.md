## Introduction
The Minimum Operations problem involves finding the minimum number of operations required to reach a certain goal state from an initial state, given a set of rules or constraints. This problem is commonly encountered in algorithmic problem-solving and optimization tasks.

## Problem Statement
Given an initial state and a goal state, along with a set of rules defining valid operations, implement a function `minOperations(n)` to determine the minimum number of operations required to reach the goal state from the initial state.

## Solution Approach
The solution to the Minimum Operations problem often involves using techniques from graph theory, dynamic programming, or heuristic search algorithms such as breadth-first search (BFS) or A* search. By modeling the problem as a graph and systematically exploring possible paths, we can determine the optimal sequence of operations to achieve the goal state.
