## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding and utilizing Pascal's Triangle. Whether you're a mathematics enthusiast, a computer science student, or simply curious about mathematical patterns, this repository has something for you.

## About Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it, forming a symmetric pattern. This triangle has various applications in combinatorics, probability theory, algebra, and number theory.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in this repository is in Python. It efficiently generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows using dynamic programming techniques. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it suitable for both educational purposes and practical applications.

## Usage
To generate Pascal's Triangle using the provided Python script, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/tris-raki/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the `0x00-pascal_triangle` directory:
	cd alx-interview/0x00-pascal_triangle
3. Run the Python script:
	python pascal_triangle.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the number of rows for Pascal's Triangle.
